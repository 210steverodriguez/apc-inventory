# apc-inventory

> Just another 5 am app idea. Customer has a problem with unknown count of laptops in the field. The application would be a website a manger can open on their mobile device while on internal network. The main index will include a field for first name, last name, button to upload a picture of the asset tag, and a manager's pin. There will be an admin panel where you create a pin with a name attached so you can know who is submitting assets. Server side will only receive data from known pins and dump all other information, maybe. With the put requests of assets from the front end we will create a visual table for admin that is exportable csv.

## Build Setup
